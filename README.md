A fine tune Neural Network Model (Neural_Network_Fine-Tune_Model.ipynb) perform the best result (Private Leaderboard RMSE: 1,806,500.16 & Public Leaderboard RMSE: 1,798,411.41) throught my various algorithm experiments without complex features enginnering.
Simply say that, more architecture work is needed for Neural Network algorithm rather than features engineering.

While a fine tune Xgboost model could still achieve close to Neural Network results (Private Leaderboard RMSE: 1,832,604.26 & Public Leaderboard RMSE: 1,797,415.06) with less expensive computation cost, but need put more effort on features engineering such as data transformation.
