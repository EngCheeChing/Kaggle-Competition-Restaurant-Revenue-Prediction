Private Leaderboard Score Rank:  231 / 2257 Teams

A fine tune Neural Network Model perform the best result (Private Leaderboard RMSE: 1,806,500.16 & Public Leaderboard RMSE: 1,798,411.41) throught my various algorithm experiments without complex features enginnering.
Simply say that, more architecture work is needed for Neural Network algorithm rather than features engineering.

The fine tune Neural Network Model coding could refer to "Neural_Network_Fine-Tune_Model.ipynb"

While a fine tune Xgboost model could still achieve close to Neural Network results (Private Leaderboard RMSE: 1,832,604.26 & Public Leaderboard RMSE: 1,797,415.06) with less expensive computation cost, but need put more effort on features engineering such as data transformation.
